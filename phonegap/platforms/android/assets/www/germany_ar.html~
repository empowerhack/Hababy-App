Hospitals are obliged to provide emergency care to undocumented migrants. 
In case of serious cares or infectious, undocumented migrants are entitled to the same publicly subsidized health care benefits as asylum seekers residing in Germany but they must have a medical card. <br>
Undocumented migrants must personally apply for a medical card in the welfare office. This deters applications since the process could eventually lead to deportation unless the undocumented migrant successfully applies for a temporary residence permit, known as Duldung. However, applying for Duldung only temporarily suspends a potential deportation.  <br>
